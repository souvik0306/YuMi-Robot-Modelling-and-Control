The Red, Green and Blue protudings denote the three axis of rotation for the robotic shoulder, giving it three degrees of freedom (3 DOF)- 
1. Yaw (Blue)
2. Pitch (Green)
3. Roll (Red)

Simularly by using  <code> iviz.MarkerBodyName = "gripper_r_base"</code> and selecting a particluar part as marker body we can move it by 3 DOFs. 
In this example we have used the gripper base.
